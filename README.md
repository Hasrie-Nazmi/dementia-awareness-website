# Dementia Awareness Website
## Website that helps users learn about dementia. The website includes features such as a reading corner to learn about dementia, quizzes, reminders to complete remaining quizzes, and a summary report on the user's progress of learning about dementia.
### This website was developed as a group assignment along with my other groupmates. Resources used in this development are:
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Bootstrap
